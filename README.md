# Note Taker Money Maker

## Description
    
The routes on the server has not been established. Using the front-end provided in the develop folder, I was able to create backend routes to direct and redirect the user to the homepage handle note saves, note delete, and note read. All of the notes data is stored as a json object.
    
  
## Usage
    
When you are directed to the homepage, the user can click on "Get Started" to acces the notes. The notes that are stored can be seen on the left side of the screen as a list, and on the right side, there is a text area for a new note. Once the user starts typing in the text area, a new button comes up that allows the user to save the note. Once the note is saved, it can be seen at the bottom of the list. The saved notes can be accessed by clicking on them, while the delete button will delete them.
